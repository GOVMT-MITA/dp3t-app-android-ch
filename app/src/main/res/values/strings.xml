    <string name="messages_nomessages_faq2_titel">What is a potential exposure?</string>
    <string name="messages_nomessages_faq2_text">The app checks how long your phone was close to that of someone who tested positive, and estimates how close.  You will receive a report only if it is suspected that you may have been significantly exposed to the virus.</string>
    <string name="messages_detail_explanation_text3">If you have or develop any symptoms, contact your doctor.</string>
    <string name="messages_messages_faq1_title">Do I have to call?</string>

    <string name="inform_detail_faq1_text">People who test positive for the new coronavirus are given a Covidcode.  This ensures that only someone who tests positive can record a positive result in the app and anonymously inform their contacts.</string>
    <string name="inform_detail_faq2_title">How do I remain anonymous?</string>
    <string name="inform_detail_faq2_text">Only encrypted (secret) codes are recorded and sent by the app.  There are no personal data.  Other phones with the same or similar apps check whether they were close to your phone in the past few days and notify their users, without ever identifying you.</string>
